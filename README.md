# hammerhead
I've created a simulation test script that uses DroneKit with SITL (Software In The Loop) to test our hammerhead maneuver. Here's what this test does:

Sets up a simulated drone environment using DroneKit-SITL
Implements the hammerhead maneuver with more detailed attitude control
Records flight data throughout the test (position, attitude, throttle)
Creates visualizations of the flight path and key parameters
Includes a safe return-to-launch after completing the maneuver

Key simulation improvements:

Uses quaternion-based attitude control for more accurate maneuver execution
Implements smoother transitions between the maneuver phases
Records comprehensive flight data for analysis
Creates 3D visualizations of the flight path and key parameters
Uses a higher starting altitude (40m) for safety during testing

To run this simulation:

You'll need to install required packages:

pip install dronekit dronekit-sitl numpy matplotlib pymavlink

Run the script, which will:

Start a simulated drone
Execute the takeoff and hammerhead maneuver
Generate visualization graphs of the flight data
Land the drone safely



The visualization will show you the 3D flight path, altitude profile, attitude angles, and throttle usage throughout the maneuver, helping validate whether the hammerhead turn executed correctly.
